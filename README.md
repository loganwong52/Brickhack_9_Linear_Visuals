## Inspiration
Linear Algebra is hard to understand. Our web app will make it easier to understand.

## What it does
It shows a graph of all possible vectors on a graph.
It takes in a 2x2 transformation matrix.
It applies this transformation on all the vectors on the graph. 
The transformation for every graph is shown in an animation.

## How we built it
We used Figma, React (a JavaScript framework), HTML, and CSS.
Link to Figma prototype: https://www.figma.com/proto/rvUfwG4gtNpAbGqUWlXXTk/Linear-Algebra-Visualizer?node-id=11%3A477&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=11%3A475 

## Challenges we ran into
Creating and using our GitHub repo.
Learning how to use chart.js
Using React.
Using CSS to make our web app look the way we want it.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Getting and using user input.
Creating a graph with points and vectors using chart.js.
Incorporating the graph into the web app.
Using the user input and applying it to be a transformation in the graph.
Animating the vectors in the graph to show the transformation.

## What we learned
Working in an impromptu team for a limited amount of time.
How to use chart.js.

## What's next for Linear Algebra Transformations Visualizer
Ultimately, it should also show animations for 2D and 3D transformations to all vectors on a graph, but we only had time to apply a 2D animation.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
