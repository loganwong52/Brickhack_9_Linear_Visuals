# Linear Algebra Visualizer

## Inspiration
Linear Algebra is difficult due to the lack of visualization of determinants and eigenvectors. We created Linear Visuals to allow users to be able to graph matrices, matrix transformations, and matrix projections. 

## What it does
It shows a graph of all possible vectors on a graph. Then, the users enter a 2x2 transformation matrix.  The graph applies the transformation to all the vectors on the graph. The action of the transformation is demonstrated through an animated motion. 

## How we built it
Linear Visuals, our website, was designed through Figma, and coding through React (a JavaScript framework), HTML, and CSS. Link to Figma prototype: https://www.figma.com/proto/rvUfwG4gtNpAbGqUWlXXTk/Linear-Algebra-Visualizer?node-id=11%3A477&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=11%3A475 

## Challenges we ran into
Starting off was difficult due to it being a challenge to create and use our GitHub Repo.  Then, we struggled to learn how to use chart.js which was a main component of our website. In addition, our team was learning how to use React (a JavaScript framework).  CSS was a struggle because we could not make LinearVisuals the way we initially wanted. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
1) Being able to get and use user input. 
2) Creating a graph with points and vectors using charts.js. 
3) Incorporating the graph into the web app.
4) Using the user input and applying it to be a transformation in the graph.
5) Animating the vectors in the graph to show the transformation.
6) Turn ing our Figma UI into React Code. 

## What we learned
1) To work in an impromptu team for a limited amount of time.
2) How to use chart.js.
3) Turning Figma UI into React Code using a ui.pkg. 

## What's next for Linear Algebra Transformations Visualizer
Once the website is finalized, we want to potentially license it to textbook manufacturers. Textbook manufacturers would reach our target market of linear algebra college students and allow us to make a profit. Long-term, we want Linear Visuals to have an animation for the transformations not only in 2D but 3D as well for all the vectors on the graph. 


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
